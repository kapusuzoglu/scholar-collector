abstract: "The digital twin paradigm that aims to integrate the information obtained from sensor data, physics models, operational data and inspection/maintenance/repair history of the system or component of interest, can potentially be used to optimize operational parameters that achieve a desired performance or reliability goal. In this paper, we discuss such a methodology for intelligent operation planning in mechanical systems. The proposed approach discusses two key components of the problem: damage diagnosis and damage prognosis. We consider the problem of diagnosis and prognosis of fatigue crack growth in a metal component, as an example. We discuss a probabilistic, Lamb-wave-scattering-based crack diagnosis framework that incorporates both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the diagnosis process. We build a Bayesian network for the Lamb-wave pitch-catch NDE using a low-fidelity physics â€¦"
