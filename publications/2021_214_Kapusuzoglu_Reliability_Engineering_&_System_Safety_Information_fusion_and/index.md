abstract: "When computational models (either physics-based or data-driven) are used for the sensitivity analysis of engineering systems, the sensitivity estimate is affected by the accuracy and uncertainty of the model. This paper considers global sensitivity analysis (GSA) for situations where both a physics-based model and experimental observations are available, and investigates physics-informed machine learning strategies to effectively combine the two sources of information in order to maximize the accuracy of the sensitivity estimate. Two representative machine learning (ML) techniques are considered, namely, deep neural networks (DNN) and Gaussian process (GP) modeling, and two strategies for incorporating physics knowledge within these techniques are investigated, namely: (i) incorporating loss functions in the ML models to enforce physics constraints, and (ii) pre-training and updating the ML model using â€¦"
