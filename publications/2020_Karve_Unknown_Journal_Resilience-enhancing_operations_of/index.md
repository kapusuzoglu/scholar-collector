abstract: "Contemporary aerospace systems undergo planned, scheduled maintenance, which relies on the predetermined schedule of maintenance, and may results in increased costs as well as risks. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is an efficient, cost-effective maintenance paradigm that ensures safe operation of aerospace systems. In this work, we discuss a methodology for increasing the time between two successive CBM operations by re-configuring operations of an electrical or mechanical component in an aerospace vehicle. We discuss the three key aspects of the problem of interest: diagnosis of the current health state, prognosis of damage growth, and optimization of system operations. As properties of aerospace systems, as well as their operational parameters, loads and environment are stochastic in nature, our methodology includes the framework for the analysis of the uncertainty in diagnosis, prognosis â€¦"
