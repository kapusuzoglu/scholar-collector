abstract: "This manuscript presents a new reduced order computational homogenization method for failure analysis of composite materials. The proposed approach relies on the discrete representation of the fracture process at the fine scale that consistently bridges to a continuum representation of damage at the coarse scale. In order to achieve very high computational efficiency, the proposed approach builds on the ideas of the eigendeformation-based reduced order homogenization method, but tracks microscale failure evolution over a set of discrete cohesive failure surfaces. The formulation concurrently achieves mesh size objectivity and multiscale consistency by establishing analytical relationships between the microstructure size and the macroscale element size. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated in the context of three-dimensional, laminated fiber reinforced composite configurations. The â€¦"
