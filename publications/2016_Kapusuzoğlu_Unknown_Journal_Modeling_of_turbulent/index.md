abstract: "The thesis is focused on the current state-of-the-art of modeling turbulent single-phase and turbulent two-phase stratified flows. This report is meant to identify and validate the most suitable candidate model for inclusion in the multiphase flow models that are being developed in the Scientific Computing group of the Delft Institute for Applied Mathematics. For that reason, as an initial step the results of single phase turbulent pipe flows which are simulated using DNS and LES methods are compared with the results of Eggels. In two-phase flows, if the gas phase is turbulent the liquid phase will become turbulent as well. If the transition occurs from stratified flow to stratified-wavy flow, the interfacial momentum transfer varies due to the existence of waves at the interface. This process makes modeling of the momentum transfer complicated. In general, when the effects of surface tension are negligible the equations for the two-phase flow and for the single-phase flow are identical, the only differences between two-phase and single phase flow equations are the variable density and viscosity. Therefore, the influence of the interface and the momentum transfer between both phases can be ignored and a simple single-phase flow model combined with an interface model can be used as an initial approximation while concentrating on modeling the turbulence in both phases away from the interface. For this reason, the one-fluid model needs to be introduced (refer to Appendix \ref{App:s62}) in order to obtain results for multiphase flows using classical single-phase flow models. In this project, two different types of numerical techniques, namely DNS and LES are …"
