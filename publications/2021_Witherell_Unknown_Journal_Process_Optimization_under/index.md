abstract: "This paper develops a computational framework to optimize the process parameters such that the bond quality between extruded polymer filaments is maximized in fused filament fabrication (FFF). A one-dimensional heat transfer analysis providing an estimate of the temperature profile of the filaments is coupled with a sintering neck growth model to assess the bond quality that occurs at the interfaces between adjacent filaments. Predicting the variability in the FFF process is essential for achieving proactive quality control of the manufactured part; however, the models used to predict the variability are affected by assumptions and approximations. This paper systematically quantifies the uncertainty in the bond quality model prediction due to various sources of uncertainty, both aleatory and epistemic, and includes the uncertainty in the process parameter optimization. Variance-based sensitivity analysis based on â€¦"
