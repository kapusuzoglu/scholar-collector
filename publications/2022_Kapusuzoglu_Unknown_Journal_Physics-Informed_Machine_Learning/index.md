abstract: "The purpose of uncertainty quantification in the system response prediction is to support decision-making under uncertainty. For complex engineering systems, recent efforts have focused on using computational models for optimizing the process parameters and analyzing the response of an engineering system for a variety of input realizations, since conducting experiments to directly measure the true response for many input realizations is often not affordable. The use of physics-based or ML models instead of experiments would be more economical than using an experiment-based trial-and-error approach in exploring a wide range of process parameter settings and their effects on the product quality. However, for complex phenomena, physics-based models can be computationally expensive and affected by model errors. Therefore, this research investigates the combination of physics-based models and â€¦"
