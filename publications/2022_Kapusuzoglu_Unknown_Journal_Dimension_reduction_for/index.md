The analysis becomes more demanding when the system inputs and outputs vary over space and time, and the problem becomes very high-dimensional. Surrogate models are often employed to replace the physics-based model to achieve computational efficiency in analyses such as uncertainty quantification and optimization. This report develops a surrogate modeling approach for such high-dimensional problems. Several methods for reducing the output dimension are explored and compared, namely, singular value decomposition (SVD), random projection (RP), and randomized SVD; and variance-based sensitivity analysis and active subspace discovery are considered for input â€¦"
