abstract: "This paper proposes a multi-level Bayesian calibration approach that fuses information from heterogeneous sources and accounts for uncertainties in modeling and measurements for time-dependent multi-component systems. The developed methodology has two elements: quantifying the uncertainty at component and system levels, by fusing all available information, and corrected model prediction. A multi-level Bayesian calibration approach is developed to estimate component-level and system-level parameters using measurement data that are obtained at different time instances for different system components. Such heterogeneous data are consumed in a sequential manner, and an iterative strategy is developed to calibrate the parameters at the two levels. This calibration strategy is implemented for two scenarios: offline and online. The offline calibration uses data that is collected over all the time-steps â€¦"
