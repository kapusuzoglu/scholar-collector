abstract: "The digital twin paradigm that integrates the information obtained from sensor data, physics models, as well as operational and inspection/maintenance/repair history of a system (or a component) of interest, can potentially be used to optimize operational parameters of the system in order to achieve a desired performance or reliability goal. In this article, we develop a methodology for intelligent mission planning using the digital twin approach, with the objective of performing the required work while meeting the damage tolerance requirement. The proposed approach has three components: damage diagnosis, damage prognosis, and mission optimization. All three components are affected by uncertainty regarding system properties, operational parameters, loading and environment, as well as uncertainties in sensor data and prediction models. Therefore the proposed methodology includes the quantification of the â€¦"
