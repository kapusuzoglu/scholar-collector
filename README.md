# Google Scholar entry collector

A Python script that collect publication information from a given google scholar
profile. It uses the [Python scholarly library](https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/).

## Use

To use it, replace the `scholar_url` in `collect_publications.py` with your
scholar URL, and run `collect_publications.py` with Python:

```bash
    python3 collect_publications.py
```

You should see something like that:

```bash
    User ID = iv1vNTYAAAAJ&hl
    User name = Berkcan Kapusuzoglu
    2013 Optimizing water permeability through the hourglass shape of aquaporins Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
    2014 Large permeabilities of hourglass nanopores: From hydrodynamics to single file transport The Journal of chemical physics
    2013 Nanofluidic osmotic diodes: Theory and molecular dynamics simulations Physical review letters
    2014 Sub-additive ionic transport across arrays of solid-state nanopores Physics of Fluids
    (...)
```

## Output

By default, publication information is written in a folder YEAR_NAME_JOURNAL,
located in `path = "./publications"`, to a file named `index.md` that can be read
with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework, just
like [my personal page](https://simongravelle.github.io). Feel free to clone and
adapt to your content.

Output looks like that:

abstract: "Aquaporin channels are able to selectively conduct water across cell membranes, with remarkable efficiency. Although molecular details are crucial to the pore performance, permeability is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation at the entrances. Could the hourglass shape of aquaporins optimize such entrance effects? We show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the channel permeability. Strikingly, the optimal opening angles compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins, suggesting that their hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeability. This work also provides guidelines to optimize the performances of artificial nanopores, with applications in desalination, ultrafiltration, or energy conversion."
